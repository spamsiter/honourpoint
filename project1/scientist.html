                    <h3>Albert Einstein</h3>                    
                    <p>Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical<br> physicist,widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of all time.<br> Einstein is known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made<br> important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.<br> Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics.<br> His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory,<br> has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". His work is also known for<br> its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics"<br>for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of<br> the photoelectric effect",a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.<br> His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming<br> synonymous with "genius".</p>

                    <h3>C V Raman</h3>
                    <p> Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman (7 November 1888 – 21 November 1970)<br> was an Indian physicist known for his work in the field of light scattering.<br> He topped the bachelor's degree examination of the University of Madras<br> with honours in physics from Presidency College at age 16. His first research<br> paper, on diffraction of light, was published in 1906 while he was still a<br> graduate student. The next year he obtained an M.A. degree. He was 19 years<br> of age when he joined the Indian Finance Service in Calcutta as Assistant<br> Accountant General. There he became acquainted with the Indian<br>Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), the first research institute<br> in India, which allowed him to do independent research and where he made<br> his major contributions in acoustics and optics.In 1954, the Government<br> of India honoured him with the first Bharat Ratna, its highest civilian<br> award.Raman received the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery<br>and was the first Asian to receive a Nobel Prize in any branch of science.<p>

                    <h3>Isaac Newton</h3>
                <p>Sir Isaac Newton (25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27<br> was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, theologian,<br>and author who is widely recognised as one of the greatest<br>mathematicians and most influential scientists of all time. A key<br>figure in the scientific revolution, his book Philosophiæ Naturalis<br>Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy),<br>first published in 1687, established classical mechanics. Newton also<br>made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German<br>mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus.</p>

                    <h3>A P J Abdul Kalam</h3>
                    <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015)<br>was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India<br>from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu<br>and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four<br>decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence<br>Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research<br>Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space<br>programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be<br>known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of<br>ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal<br>organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests<br>in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>

                    <h3>Marie Curie</h3>
                    <p>Marie Curie (born 7 November 1867 – 4 July 1934), was a<br>Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who<br>conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. As the first<br>of the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes, she was the<br>first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and the<br>only woman to win the Nobel Prize twice, and the only person<br>to win the Nobel Prize in two scientific fields. She was the first<br>woman to become a professor at the University of Paris in 1906.<br>Marie won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery<br>of the elements polonium and radium, using techniques she<br>invented for isolating radioactive isotopes.<p>

                    <h3>Stephen Hawking</h3>
                    <p>Stephen William Hawking (8 January 1942 – 14 March 2018)<br>was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author<br>who was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical<br>Cosmology at the University of Cambridge at the time of his<br>death.He was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the<br>University of Cambridge between 1979 and 2009.Hawking's<br>scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose<br>on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of<br>general relativity and the theoretical prediction that black holes<br>emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation.Hawking was<br>the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union<br>of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He<br>was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of<br>quantum mechanics.Hawking achieved commercial success<br>with several works of popular science in which he discussed<br>his theories and cosmology in general.  </p>

                    <h3>Nikola Tesla</h3>
                    <p>Nikola Tesla (10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American<br>inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best<br>known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating<br>current (AC) electricity supply system.His alternating current (AC)<br>induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by<br>Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of<br>money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which<br>that company eventually marketed. Tesla conducted a range of<br>experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge<br>tubes, and early X-ray imaging.  Tesla experimented with a series of<br>inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success.</p>
