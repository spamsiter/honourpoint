                        polymath – poet, writer, playwright, composer, philosopher, social<br>reformer and painter.He
                        reshaped Bengali literature and music as well as<br>Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the
                        late 19th and early 20th<br>centuries. Author of the "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful
                        verse"<br>of Gitanjali,he became in 1913 the first non-European to win the Nobel<br>Prize in
                        Literature.Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and<br>mercurial; however, his
                        "elegant prose and magical poetry" remain<br>largely unknown outside Bengal.He is sometimes
                        referred to as "the <br>Bird of Bengal."</p>
